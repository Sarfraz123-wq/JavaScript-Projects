The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open js/app.js and start building out the app's functionality.

In the first step, I build navbar using the concepts of DOM using 
document.createElement then i used the innerHTML property to name
the navbar list menu and added a link of sections in list menu bar. After that i write the code to change the navigaion bgcolor when scroll down/up using addEventListener and inside it I added new classes using classList.add method for colored navbar and transparent. In the last step, I done the code for acive class when a user clicks or scrolls to the specific section it should shows the current section or current menu list is being viewed.

This project has been enhanced with dynamic generated Navigation list (based on the sections) in an unordered list as well as scrolling to the section.
